## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I never knew about the css ` mix-blend-mode: ` property. 
I had fun playing around with its various attributes until I landed with `multiply`.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```
